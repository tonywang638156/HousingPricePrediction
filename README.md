### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following features:
- **LivingSqFt**: Square footage of the living area.
- **RoomsNbr**: Number of rooms in the property.
- **Med.Income**: Median income of the area.
- **Perc_18**: Percentage of the population under 18.
- **Price.Annual**: Target variable representing the annual housing price.

## Features of the Project

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
   - Feature engineering with interaction terms like `RoomSize_Avg` and `Income_Percentage`.
   - Handling missing values and removing highly correlated features.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
   - Neural Network for regression using TensorFlow/Keras.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for measuring model performance.
   - **RÂ² Score** to evaluate the model's ability to explain variance.

4. **Model Saving and Deployment**:
   - Models are saved using `joblib` and `TensorFlow` for reuse without retraining.
